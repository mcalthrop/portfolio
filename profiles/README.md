profiles
====

## Purpose
This is a sample HTML5 / JS / CSS application that displays profiles of selected people.

It is intended as a demonstration of technical capabilities rather than design or helpful data. :-)

## Demo site
http://www.mattcalthrop.com/portfolio/profiles/

View on different devices to see how the design changes (common codebase &ndash; no m-dot).

## Features
This demonstrates the use of the following:
* semantic HTML5
* Unobtrusive JS
* Responsive web development/design
* well-structured CSS using LESS
* AMD (RequireJS)
* Twitter Bootstrap
* HandleBars
* Page data sourced via XHR JSON object

## Pipeline
Next features to be developed:
* modularisation of JS code
* JS unit testing

## Usage
Fork, and modify the contents of the `svc/pagedata.json` file to suit your requirements.

Observe the contents of the sample file to see what fields to fill in.
